# metu-food-finder
A Python script that allows you to see if your favourite food item will be offered this month at METU Cafeteria.

## How to Use
Simply run the script with Python 3, and follow the instructions. To exit, hit Ctrl+D.

### But the instructions are in Turkish?
Yeah, I know. Since the food names and every other information on the Cafeteria page is in Turkish, I kinda had to make it Turkish. But one day an English version pop up, keep watching!
